Step aboard the USCSS Nostromo and access the ship's mainframe computer system. This faithful recreation of the MU-TH-UR 6000 terminal from Ridley Scott's *Alien* (1979) brings the atmospheric dread of deep space to your browser.

## 🛸 **[>> CONNECT TO TERMINAL <<](https://jcar.github.io/muthur-terminal/)**

*No installation required - runs directly in your browser*

## What You'll Find Here

This is a pixel-perfect recreation of the MU-TH-UR 6000 mainframe computer from the 1979 film *Alien*. Every detail has been painstakingly reproduced - from the green phosphor glow of the CRT monitors to the authentic startup sequence that audiences saw aboard the USCSS Nostromo.

**Key Features:**
- Full ship systems monitoring (life support, engines, navigation, sensors)
- Complete crew database with authentic character details from the film
- Interactive ship's logs and mission briefings
- The infamous Special Order 937 (accessible with proper clearance)
- Real-time alien organism detection and tracking
- Emergency protocols and self-destruct sequences
- Multiple user authentication levels matching the film's hierarchy

## Access Credentials

To log into the terminal, use any of these crew member IDs:

- **RIPLEY** (Ellen Ripley - Warrant Officer) - Full system access
- **ASH** (Ash - Science Officer) - Synthetic override capabilities  
- **DALLAS** (Arthur J. Dallas - Captain) - Command-level access
- **KANE** (Thomas Kane - Executive Officer) - Limited access
- **LAMBERT** (Joan Lambert - Navigator) - Navigation systems
- **PARKER** (Dennis Parker - Chief Engineer) - Engineering access
- **BRETT** (Samuel Brett - Engineering Technician) - Maintenance systems

Try typing **HELP** after logging in to see available commands.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't just another retro terminal simulator. Every aspect has been researched and implemented to match the film:

- **Authentic 1979 computer behavior** - No modern conveniences or interfaces
- **Real CRT monitor effects** - Scanlines, phosphor glow, and screen flicker
- **Film-accurate data** - All crew information, ship specs, and mission details match the source material
- **Progressive revelation** - Discover the horror of the alien organism through authentic computer logs
- **Multiple story paths** - Different access levels reveal different aspects of the Nostromo's fate

## For Developers

Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features include:
- Static site generation for GitHub Pages deployment
- Responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Custom password manager blocking for authentic retro experience
- Aggressive auto-scrolling to mimic real terminal behavior
- Comprehensive test coverage of all ship systems

```bash
# Run locally
npm install
npm run dev
```

## The Technical Challenge

Recreating a 1979 computer interface in a modern browser presented unique challenges:
- Preventing modern browser features (autocomplete, password managers) from interfering
- Implementing authentic terminal scrolling behavior
- Achieving pixel-perfect CRT monitor effects
- Balancing film accuracy with usability across devices

Every detail matters when you're trying to capture the claustrophobic atmosphere of deep space.
